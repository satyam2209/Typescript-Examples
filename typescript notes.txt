what is typescript
--------------------

. TS is an enhanced version of javascript
. We could say superset of javascript
. You can understand like c++ is an enhanced version of c language
. Typescript is building on javascript
. TS is not a new language. this is just add some new features in JS

. but TS can not run on the browser directly
. So what is the benefit of it ? if we can not run it on browser!
. TS compiler convert the code from Typescript to javascript

TYPESCRIPT BENEFIT
-------------------

. Check Error on Compile Time
. Add type like string, number, bool etc
. We can add Object-Oriented Way with TS
. Code is well Managed

VERSION AND HISTORY
---------------------

. Developed By Microsoft
. First Released: 1 Oct 2012
. Influenced by: JavaScript

CORE TYPES
---------------

Number
String
Boolean

TYPE INFERENCE
---------------

let data = "hello";   // then by default data is type of string
data = 10; (syntax error)
data = "hie";  (true)

if we not assign any value at time of declaration then, after we assign any type of value

let data;
data = "hie";
data = 10;
data = true;

we also assign a specific value type like we are not assign any value of same type also.

let num:5;
num = 10; (syntax error)
num = 5;  (correct)

let str:"hie";
str = "hello"; (syntax error)
str = "hie";  (correct)

in let and const

const val = 10;  (type of val is 10 because we not assign any other value)
let val = 10;  (type of val is number)

OBJECT TYPE
------------
// both are empty object
let person:{};
let person:object;

// this is wrong way
const person:{}={
    name: "satyam",
    age: 22
}
console.log(person.name);   // this is syntax error because person is empty object

// this is correct way
const person:{name:string, age:number}={
   name: "satyam",
   age: 22
}
console.log(person.name);

ARRAY TYPE
-----------

let arr:string[] = ["php", "js", "ts", "node"];

if limited values then,
let random:[string, number, boolean] = ["abc", 123, true]; // this is tuple

if many numbers of data then, both are correct
let random = ["abc", 123, true, 23, false];
let random:any[] = ["abc", 123, true, 23, false];

TUPLE
------

let random1:[string, number, boolean] = ["abc", 123, true];

let random2:[string, number, string, boolean?] = ["abc", 123, "hello"];
// if we want to push new another type of value in random variable Then add in last type as well as questionMark
random.push(true)
random[0] = 12;   // at 0th position there is string so we can not assign a number value

ENUM TYPE
----------

. A group of constant
. That can assign a number to your string and make an easy comparison.
. Ex:- enum Role[values]

Ex: enum Role{
    ADMIN,MANAGER,READ_ONLY_USER
}
console.log(Role.MANAGER);   // 1


ANY TYPE
----------

the any type is a special type that allows a variable to hold any kind of value,

let variable: any;

variable = "Hello"; // string
variable = 42;      // number
variable = true;    // boolean
variable = { name: "Alice" }; // object


UNION TYPE
-----------

a union type allows a variable to hold a value of multiple types. You define a union type using the | (pipe) symbol between the types.

Ex:-  function combine(a:number | string, b:number | string)
      {
         if(typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number')
         {
           return a + b;
         }
         else
         {
           return a.toString()+b.toString();
         }
      }
        console.log(combine(10,20));

        console.log(combine("satyam","singh"));


LITERAL TYPE
-------------

a literal is a specific value that you directly write in the code. Literals can be numbers, strings, booleans, or even more specific types.

Ex: Let Data:"abc"|123="abc"

Ex:-  function combines(a: number | string, b: number | string, type:"as-number" | "as-string")
      {
         if(type === "as-number")
         {
           return (+a)+(+b)
         }
         else
         {
           return a.toString() + b.toString();
         }
      }

       console.log(combines(10,20,"as-number"))

       console.log(combines("satyam","singh","as-string"))


TYPE ALIAS
------------

a type alias is a way to create a new name for a type. This can make complex types easier to read and reuse. You define a type alias using the type 
keyword followed by the alias name and then assign it a type.


Ex: type varType = string | number | undefined;
    let x: varType = 10;
    let y: varType = 10;
    let z: varType = 10;

FUNCTION TYPE
--------------

a function type defines the type signature of a function, specifying the types of its parameters and the type of the value it returns.

Ex: function add(a:number, b:number):number
    {
      return a+b;
    }
    add(10,20);

Ex: const num = 10;
    const str = "hello";
    const cc = undefined;


    function add():number
    {
         return num;
      // return str;   syntax error
    }

    add()

// que => can we a function of undefined types


VOID FUNCTION
---------------

a void function is a function that does not return any value. It is specified by the void return type. When a function's return type is void, 
it means that the function either does not use a return statement or uses it without returning any value

Ex: function logMessage(message: string): void {
      console.log(message);
    }

// but we dont need to write its void type when we not return anything the function take it default

Ex: let today;

    function printData()
    {
      today = 10*20*4;
    }

    printData();


UNKNOWN TYPES
---------------

In TypeScript, unknown is a type that means "I don't know what this is yet." It can hold any value, but before you can use it, 
you must first check what type it is. This is safer than any, which allows any operation without checks. unknown helps prevent errors 
by making sure you handle values correctly


Ex:-  

// ---------  Diff between any and unkown  --------------


// ------ ANY TYPE -------

let data:any;
data = 20;
data = "hello";

let item1:string;
item1 = data;

// type any is switched of the rules of typescript show that i can use any as i wish.


// -------- UNKNOWN TYPE --------

let data2:unknown;
data2 = 20;
data2 = "hello";

let item2:string;
// we cannot assign unkown type variable in others type variable directly there is some alternate options.
// item2 = data2;   // this gives error because we cannot assig it directly

// You must first check or assert the type
if (typeof data2 === 'string') {
    item2 = data2; // Now it's safe to assign
  }
  
  // Alternatively, using a type assertion
  item2 = data2 as string; // This will bypass the type checking, but be careful with it


NEVER TYPE FUNCTION
---------------------

A never type in TypeScript is for functions that never finish, either because they throw an error or run forever. 
A void type is for functions that finish but don’t return any value, just undefined.

Ex:- 
// it return true
function tryReturn()
{
   return true;
}  

Ex:-
// it return undefined known as void type function. (by default in any function when we return nothing it is void type)

// it return 3 and undefined
function tryReturn()
{
   console.log(1 + 2);
}  

Ex:-
// it return nothing instead it is infinite loop or the function that is throw and error or messages.

Ex:-
function tryReturn(): never {
    throw new Error("This function never returns");
}

console.log(tryReturn()); // This will throw an error and terminate execution.


HOW TO CREATE tscconfig.json FILE
-------------------------------------

run=> tsc init   (this create file)

for compile typescript in javascript => npx tsc

for auto compile typescript to javascript => tsc -w or tsc --watch

for compile typescript direct without converting in js => npx ts-node Folder_Name/File_Name.ts


INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE in tsconfig.json
--------------------------------------

In tsconfig.json, the include and exclude options are used to control which files are included or excluded in the TypeScript compilation process.

---include----
include specifies an array of file patterns to include in the compilation process. Only the files that match these patterns will be compiled.

Example:
{
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
// This example includes all files in the src directory and its subdirectories.


---exclude----
exclude specifies an array of file patterns to exclude from the compilation process. These files will not be compiled, even if they match 
a pattern in the include array.

Example:
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}


When both include and exclude are used in tsconfig.json, TypeScript follows these rules:

=> If neither include nor exclude is provided, TypeScript will automatically include all .ts files in the project folder, except for files in the 
node_modules folder.

=> If both are specified, TypeScript will only compile files that match the patterns in include, but it will ignore any files that also match the 
patterns in exclude.

In short, include defines what files to compile, and exclude defines what files to ignore, even if they were included.


TARGET IN tsconfig.json
-------------------------

In a tsconfig.json file for TypeScript, the target option specifies the version of JavaScript that TypeScript should compile the code to.

For example:

"target": "ES5" will compile the TypeScript code to be compatible with ECMAScript 5 (ES5), which is widely supported by most browsers.
"target": "ES6" (or ES2015) will compile the code to ECMAScript 6, which has more modern JavaScript features.

Choosing the right target ensures your TypeScript code runs correctly on the environments you want to support 
(like specific browsers or Node.js versions).


rootDir and outDir in tsconfig.json
-------------------------------------

In a tsconfig.json file for a TypeScript project:

rootDir: This specifies the root folder that contains the TypeScript source files (.ts files). It's the directory where TypeScript looks for the 
source files to compile. For example, if rootDir is set to "src", TypeScript will consider all files inside the src folder as source files.

outDir: This specifies the output directory where the compiled JavaScript files will be placed after TypeScript compiles the .ts files. 
For example, if outDir is set to "dist", all compiled .js files will be placed in the dist folder.

Together, rootDir and outDir help organize your TypeScript project by defining where the source files are located and where the compiled files should go.


CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS
----------------------------------

there is some keys in tsconfig.json file in TYPESCRIPT


Certainly! Here’s a brief summary of each TypeScript option:

1. strict: Enables all strict type-checking options for better error catching and more reliable code.

2. noImplicitAny: Forces you to explicitly declare types for variables and parameters to avoid unintended type errors.

3. strictNullChecks: Differentiates between null, undefined, and other types to prevent runtime errors due to unexpected nullish values.

4. noUnusedLocals: Flags errors for local variables that are declared but not used, helping to clean up unused code.

5. noUnusedParameters: Flags errors for function parameters that are not used within the function, keeping function signatures clean.

6. noImplicitReturns: Ensures that every code path in a function returns a value, helping to avoid bugs from missing returns.

7. noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: Prevents fall-through in switch cases unless explicitly defined, reducing logical errors in switch statements.

8. forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: Ensures file names are consistently cased in imports, avoiding issues in case-sensitive file systems.

9. esModuleInterop: Improves compatibility with JavaScript modules, making imports from CommonJS modules smoother.

10. strictFunctionTypes: Ensures function types are checked strictly to prevent errors in function arguments and return types.

11. strictBindCallApply: Checks that bind, call, and apply methods are used with correct argument types.

12. strictPropertyInitialization: Ensures all class properties are initialized properly.

13. alwaysStrict: Forces strict mode for all files, catching errors early.




CLASS IN TYPESCRIPT
--------------------

=> What is class

. A class is a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object ?
. We can define property and methods in class?

Ex: 
class Users{
   name:string = "";
   email:string = "";

   addUser(user:string): string
   {
     return `${user} is Added`
   }
   removeUser(user:string): string 
   {
     return `${user} is Removed`
   }
}

let User1 = new Users;
console.log(User1.addUser('Anil'));   // Anil is Added
console.log(User1.removeUser("Anil"));  // Anil is Removed
console.log(User1);    // Users {name: "", email: ""}
console.log(Users);    // [class Users]


ACCESS MODIFIERS
-----------------
access modifiers control the visibility of class members (properties or methods).
 
There are three types:

1. Public => Members are accessible everywhere (default).
2. Private => Members are only accessible within the class.
3. Protected => Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.

Example : 
 Public => all methods and properties are accessible outside the class because it is public by default

 class Users1{
     name=""

    setName(name:string)
    {
        this.name=name;
    }
    displayName()
    {
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}

const u1 = new Users1;
u1.setName("anil");
u1.name = "sidhu";   
u1.displayName();


Example : 
 Private => all methods and properties are only accessible within the class because using keyword private

 class Users1{
    private name=""

    setName(name:string)
    {
        this.name=name;
    }
    displayName()
    {
        console.log(this.name)
        this.getNameLength()
    }
    private getNameLength()
    {
        console.log(this.name.length)
    }
}

const u1 = new Users1;
u1.setName("satyam singh");
// u1.name = "sidhu"; it is not accessible outside class because it is private
u1.displayName();
// u1.getNameLength(); it is also not accessible outside class because it is private

Constructor and Shorthand Initialization
-------------------------------------------
=> a constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It helps initialize 
the properties of the class.

Example => 
class UsersConstruct{
    name="";
    age=0;
    email=""
    constructor(name:string, age:number, email:string)
    {
        // console.log("constructor called");
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
        this.email=email;
    }
    displayVal()
    {
        console.log(this.name, this.age, this.email);
    }
}
const ex = new UsersConstruct("satyam", 22, "satyam@gmail.com");
const ex1 = new UsersConstruct("raj", 27, "raj@gmail.com");
ex.displayVal();
ex1.displayVal();

---- Shorthand Initialization :=> 
In TypeScript, instead of manually assigning properties inside the constructor, you can use shorthand initialization by declaring the 
properties directly in the constructor parameters.

Example => 
class shortHand{
    constructor(public name:string, public age:number, public email:string ){  }

    displayValue(){
        console.log(this.name, this.age, this.email);
    }
}

const sh = new shortHand("satyam", 22, "satyam@123");
const sh1 = new shortHand("raj", 27, "raj@gmail.com");

sh.displayValue();
sh1.displayValue();


In this version:
The public keyword automatically creates and initializes the property, making the code shorter and cleaner.


Difference Between readonly and private
-----------------------------------------
=> readonly: Means you can set a value once, but after that, you can't change it.

=> private: Means something is hidden from the outside. You can only use or change it inside the class.

Example : 
class Example{
    readonly name='anil';
    private age = 12;
}

const exa = new Example();
// exa.name="peter";  it is readonly thats why i cannot update its value but i can access this property outside class
// exa.age;  it is private thats why i cannot acess this property outside class and also cannot update itsvalue
console.log(exa.name);
// console.log(exa.age);


Inheritance
-------------
Inheritance in TypeScript allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This is useful for code reuse and 
creating a hierarchy of classes.

Here's a simple breakdown:

Base Class/Parent Class: This is the class that provides common properties and methods.
Derived Class/Child Class: This is the class that inherits from the base class and can use or override its properties and methods.

Example =>
class CreateAccount{
    makeEmail(user:string)
    {
        return `${user}@test.com`
    }
}

class User_s extends CreateAccount{
    addUser(user:string){
        return `${user} added as an User`;
    }
}

const use1 = new User_s();
console.log(use1.addUser("satyam"));
console.log(use1.makeEmail("satyam"));


class Employess extends CreateAccount{
    addEmployee(emp:string)
    {
        return `${emp} is added as an employee`
    }
}

const E1 = new Employess();
console.log(E1.addEmployee("Sam"));
console.log(E1.makeEmail("sam"));
